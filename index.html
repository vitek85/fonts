                <p class="first">This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve
                    o'clock a troop of
                    ten
                    or
                    twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to
                    clear
                    the way with its cow–catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along
                    with a
                    tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening
                    bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing
                    can
                    moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain. </p>

                <p class="second">The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg,
                    who had the most
                    reason
                    of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please the
                    buffaloes to get out of the way.
                    Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of
                    revolvers
                    upon
                    them.
                </p>

                <p class="third">"What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession,
                    just as if they
                    were
                    not
                    impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme!
                    And
                    here's
                    an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"</p>

                he was wise.
